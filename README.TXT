PROJECT TITLE: Feeding Nemo

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Assignment 2

UNIT CODE: ISY00245

UNIT NAME: Principles of Programming

TUTOR: Alex Hendry   

VERSION or DATE: 1.0 | 11/08/2017

AUTHOR: Jaydel Bujawe

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Click on the title screen to play. Make sure to read instructions.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

Use arrow keys up, right, left, down to move Nemo. Keys A and D can also be used to move Nemo from left to right respectively.

Avoid sharks all the time. If you get eaten by a shark, the game will be over. There is one shark at the start of the game. However as you have eaten more planktons, more sharks will be added. Every 3, 6, 9 eaten planktons a shark will be added. Every 8 and 9 eaten planktons, the sharks will get aggressive and will move faster. Lastly, if you have eaten 9 planktons, a shark will be set to your direction so watch out.

Eat all planktons in the screen. There are a total of 10 planktons every start of the game. A glowing plankton is recommended to be eaten first as the image of the glowing plankton is slightly bigger than the set image, therefore by a mere touch of the glowing plankton, it can be eaten instantly compared to the default image of plankton. However, the difference is not significant.

Timer is also available in the game. Therefore, you can compare if you have beaten your previous highest time score.
Highest time score is determined by the least amount of act cycles needed to finish the game.
